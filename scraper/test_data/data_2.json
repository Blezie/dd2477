               "description":"See also: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/383606.Robert_Galbraith\" title=\"Robert Galbraith\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Robert Galbraith</a><br />Although she writes under the pen name <b>J.K. Rowling</b>, pronounced like <i>rolling</i>, her name when her first <i>Harry Potter</i> book was published was simply <b>Joanne Rowling</b>. Anticipating that the target audience of young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman, her publishers demanded that she use two initials, rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose <b>K</b> as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother Kathleen Ada Bulgen Rowling. She calls herself <b>Jo</b> and has said, \"No one ever called me \\'Joanne\\' when I was young, unless they were angry.\" Following her marriage, she has sometimes used the name <b>Joanne Murray</b> when conducting personal business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name of <b>Joanne Kathleen Rowling</b>. In a 2012 interview, Rowling noted that she no longer cared that people pronounced her name incorrectly.<br /><br />Rowling was born to Peter James Rowling, a Rolls-Royce aircraft engineer, and Anne Rowling (née Volant), on 31 July 1965 in Yate, Gloucestershire, England, 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Bristol. Her mother Anne was half-French and half-Scottish. Her parents first met on a train departing from King\\'s Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964. They married on 14 March 1965. Her mother\\'s maternal grandfather, Dugald Campbell, was born in Lamlash on the Isle of Arran. Her mother\\'s paternal grandfather, Louis Volant, was awarded the Croix de Guerre for exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte during the First World War.<br /><br />Rowling\\'s sister Dianne was born at their home when Rowling was 23 months old. The family moved to the nearby village Winterbourne when Rowling was four. She attended St Michael\\'s Primary School, a school founded by abolitionist William Wilberforce and education reformer Hannah More. Her headmaster at St Michael\\'s, Alfred Dunn, has been suggested as the inspiration for the <i>Harry Potter</i> headmaster Albus Dumbledore.<br /><br />As a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories, which she would usually then read to her sister. She recalls that: \"I can still remember me telling her a story in which she fell down a rabbit hole and was fed strawberries by the rabbit family inside it. Certainly the first story I ever wrote down (when I was five or six) was about a rabbit called Rabbit. He got the measles and was visited by his friends, including a giant bee called Miss Bee.\" At the age of nine, Rowling moved to Church Cottage in the Gloucestershire village of Tutshill, close to Chepstow, Wales. When she was a young teenager, her great aunt, who Rowling said \"taught classics and approved of a thirst for knowledge, even of a questionable kind,\" gave her a very old copy of Jessica Mitford\\'s autobiography, <i>Hons and Rebels</i>. Mitford became Rowling\\'s heroine, and Rowling subsequently read all of her books.<br /><br />Rowling has said of her teenage years, in an interview with The New Yorker, \"I wasn’t particularly happy. I think it’s a dreadful time of life.\" She had a difficult homelife; her mother was ill and she had a difficult relationship with her father (she is no longer on speaking terms with him). She attended secondary school at Wyedean School and College, where her mother had worked as a technician in the science department. Rowling said of her adolescence, \"Hermione [a bookish, know-it-all <i>Harry Potter</i> character] is loosely based on me. She\\'s a caricature of me when I was eleven, which I\\'m not particularly proud of.\" Steve Eddy, who taught Rowling English when she first arrived, remembers her as \"not exceptional\" but \"one of a group of girls who were bright, and quite good at English.\" Sean Harris, her best friend in the Upper Sixth owned a turquoise Ford Anglia, which she says inspired the one in her books.",

I wish this had been longer. <br><br>This book has always been my favorite in the series. Up until it, Harry’s story had been filled with light. Sure, there were some tough parts earlier on, and while it\\'s true that some darkness crept into the ending of the previous installment, for the most part, that was a pretty happy book compared to this. Ron got over his jealousy, the school eventually got behind Harry as a Champion, and good still triumphed over evil. Our hero surmounted impossible odds in the Triwizard Tournament and then managed to escape Voldemort, yet again, and warn the wizarding world of his return. <br><br>And then <b>BAM!</b><br><br>The beginning of this book hits you in the face. Where you expect Harry to be in the know, he’s in the dark, where you expect The Daily Prophet to be filled with stories about the ministry pursuing Voldemort, there’s only silence, where you expect excitement about returning to Hogwarts there is only frustration and angst. And you know what? You get it, you frigging get it, man. <br><br>Because you were with Harry when he faced Voldemort and his Death Eaters alone, you stood beside him as the shades of his parents appeared from the tip of his enemy’s wand and helped save his life. And when he made it back to safety, you were just as dumbfounded as he was when the minister of magic refused to believe him, refused to believe Dumbledore. <br><br>So how dare they? How dare they let him rot, alone, in a house full of people who hate and ridicule him, while the murderer of his parents begins to rebuild his army? How dare they feed him snippets like “We can’t tell you anything about what we’ve been doing, and we’ve been doing A LOT. But don’t worry, we’ll see you soon, we just can’t tell you when”? As if he hasn’t been through enough. If anyone has the right to know what’s going on, it’s Harry. Doesn’t anyone KNOW him like we do? Or do they just think that they know what’s best for him better than he does? <br><br>And that’s part of the genius of this installment. This book grows up. Where the previous four could be labeled as children’s stories, this one cannot. There are so many hard lessons and difficult themes in this, ones that a child’s mind cannot fully grasp. Gone are the heroes, gone are the happy endings. This book teaches you that adults aren’t the perfect protectors you thought they were. Sirius isn’t infallible. James Potter isn’t infallible. Albus frigging Dumbledore isn’t infallible. None of them are. None of them are even fully good. And come to find out, those you thought were fully evil might not be either. This book introduces you to shades of grey, and each revelation seems to hit you harder than the last. <br><br>Normally, I hate angst. This is mostly because I find the vast majority of what I see these days to be a sorry excuse to lengthen a story or a shoddy attempt to distract a reader from glaring issues. Trying to cover up weak characterization? Add some angst! Want to hide those holes in your plot? Add some angst! <br><br>The only type of angst I can stand is believable angst. Rowling delivers on this. And that’s one of the many reasons that I love this book. There are a lot of other reasons, Fred and George’s badassery, Ginny Weasley finding her voice and becoming a character in her own right, the undiluted rage that coursed through my body every time I read a scene that included Delores Umbridge, the incredible courage and honesty of Hermione Granger, the loyalty of Ron Weasley, Neville Longbottom coming into his own, the failed Occlumency lessons (I WILL ALWAYS HATE SNAPE) and the way the entire school ended up doing exactly what the sorting hat suggested at the beginning of the year and banded together as one against the ministry’s interference. <br><br>I even loved the ending. YES, I SAID IT! And do you know why? Because life isn’t sunshine and roses and you don’t always get to say goodbye to those you love. You don’t get the sense that Sirius’s death was a righteous one. You don’t get resolution. He didn’t make some grand sacrifice to save the lives of many others. He died taunting the bad guys, smiling at them, egging them on as though he was still that ego-inflated teenager you glimpsed through the pensieve. And then you find out that it was all for nothing. That there were so many ways that it could have been avoided. How do you deal with that? The best you can, I guess. <br><br>So while I don’t necessarily \"enjoy\" this book as much as I do the others, it remains my favorite in the series for the reasons I listed above.<br><br><b><a href=\"http://www.thealliterates.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Blog</a> | <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thealliterates/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thealliterates\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/the_alliterates/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/thealliterates/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Pinterest</a></b>",

This Lord Voldything\\'s back, you say.\"</i>\n</b><br /><br />When a book gets too long, there\\'s always the risk of giving up halfway, or start skimming through parts. I think, The Order of Phoenix qualifies as long (the version I read had around a 1000 pages), but I wish it to be even longer. Only Rowling can do that. I didn\\'t find one boring bit, or anything out of place. We are reaching a near-perfect level of writing here at the fifth of the series, which, in my opinion, is an excellent concoction of suspense, hope, triumph, disappointment, humor, anger, happiness, sadness and so many others.<br /><br /><b>\n  <i>\"I\\'ve always wanted to try firewhisky -\"</i>\n</b><br /><br />Right from the beginning, you\\'ll find everything to be intriguing as always, with an excellent set of new characters being introduced. The main characters around Harry are of course the main focus, and the narration inherits a lot from how the teenage Harry views the world. Average emotional rollercoaster of a teenager blends in nicely with the main plot, and makes things more interesting.<br /><br /><b>\n  <i>\"Ask us no questions and we\\'ll tell you no lies,\"</i>\n</b><br /><br />We\\'ve finally moved in to the core of the story, and an-action-packed story is being unfolded - full of dark times - with no more holding back. If it wasn\\'t for Rowling\\'s writing, this might\\'ve felt like one complex story, not to mention how unbearable it would\\'ve been with Umbrige, and also with Lestrange and Fudge closely behind. But everything\\'s put in place perfectly, and even the annoying characters do their part really well. And the ending chapters - though disappointing - are the best and most dramatic in the series so far. This has been one amazing ride, while proving the \\'Last-is-Best\\' still to be true.<br /><br /><b>\n  <i>\"Youth cannot know how age thinks and feels. But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young...\"</i>\n</b>",

Harry and Sirius-</b> they never had much time together but the time they did have really influenced Harry’s development, a few wise words from a sincere friend (or godfather) can go a real long way. And this scene was perhaps the most powerfully written in the series for me, we all know what happens next: <br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1517510662ra/24983353.gif\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1517510662ra/24983354.gif\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br><b>2. Dumbledore’s Army-</b> Harry, Ron and Hermione have always taken matters into their own hands; they’ve never waited for someone to come along and save them. And here they have got so many great characters involved in their heroics, which leads me onto my next point. <br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1517510084i/24983298.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br><b>3. Luna Lovegood-</b> because the weird people are always the best people. Luna’s by far my favourite character because she is so completely herself in all her colourfulness; she’s often ignored, avoided and even ridiculed as a result but secretly she is brilliant. The world needs more Luna Lovegoods. I always thought she had far more chemistry with Harry than Ginny ever did. <br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1427485808ra/14276175.gif\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">",

               "text":"EDIT: I have close bonds with several transgender people, and I do not support this author at this point, as she actively uses her financial power to wreak havoc on the lives of trans people. <br /><br /><br /><i>\n  <b>⭐️In Defensse of Harry Potter: Order of the Pheonix</b>\n</i><br />So this is my second favorite book of Harry Potter. And I plan to tell you exactly why the fuck why. <br /><br />Order of the Pheonix is the most emotional book of the entire series, in a lot of ways. You have the visit to Neville's parents, Harry's ending breakdown as a character, the backstory behind Snape and Sirius... It deals with the deep emotional stuff in a way that the first few books didn't, with the possible exception of Prisoner of Azkaban. <b>This book will make you cry.</b><br /><br /><i>\n  <b>⭐️Interlude: In Defense of Harrry's Angst Phase</b>\n</i><br /><br />Harry is an incredibly traumatized young adult who's just been isolated from every person who cares about him all summer. Literally every single person who cares about him. You try being dropped in that situation and not being upset, especially as a fifteen-year-old. But what really stands out here is Harry's character arc as he comes to be less angsty. This book took him to his bottom point and to his top and it's brilliant. <br /><br /><i>\n  <b>Return To Actual Review</b>\n</i><br /><br />J.K. Rowling really nails down her tonal shifts in this book. The darker tone really takes this series to the next level in terms of plot AND character work. <b>Order of the Pheonix is so dark and yet so <i>hopeful</i>.</b> It's about resisting oppression in any way you can and it's just a perfect fucking book god I love this book so much <br /><br />The plotting is brilliant, incorporating one of the most terrifying villains I have ever read about in my entire life. She's so <i>human</i> and that's what makes her such a terrifying character. Also, the plot reveals at the end. The interesting twist on the chosen one trope in regards to Neville. <br /><br />The side characters and the entire concept of the DA and their bonding as a team really stand out here. <b>There's something incredibly powerful in Harry Potter, who has worked alone the last few books, needing to ask for help. Harry realizes that he <i>doesn't have to be alone</i>.</b> This book also deals with the fact that adults aren't perfect, even when they love you and want to help you. Also, Ginny Weasley is fucking perfect. Why do all of you sleep on her verbal DRAG of Harry? “I forgo–” “LUCKY YOU” <br /><br />This book is also undoubtedly the funniest of the series. Fred and George. The school resistance to Umbridge. I don't know, maybe Lord Voldemort? IT UNSCREWS THE OTHER WAY.<br /><br />This book is just fucking perfect. My mother is giving me annoyed looks while reading this review on her goodreads app but I don't care, this book is perfect.",

But he stood up for what was right, the truth, not the sweet lies, or what was easy; even if he would be punished. He didn\\'t back away from his words, just because those idiots didn\\'t like it. (that\\'s why I like the heroes; strong, brave, standing up for what is right)<br>I was sad with him. My heart was broken for him.<br><br>the World\\'s getting darker . more pressure on Harry.

It went by so slow and I felt like too much went on but at the same time nothing really happened. This book could've easily been made at least 200 pages shorter if J.K. Rowling got rid of all the pointless details and chapters that added nothing significant to the storyline. The movie was never really one of my favorites either and that was probably the primary reason it took me more than a month to get through Order of the Phoenix.<br /><br />On top of that, I wasn't a big fan of Harry in this book. I understand that he went through a whole lot after the events of Goblet of Fire but he was moody and a jerk to everyone around him 98% of the time and although I can empathize with him, it became too over the top for me and I got tired of it real fast. He just kept snapping and going off on all the wrong people and it got really annoying. All the constant CAPITALIZED yelling didn't help too much either.<br /><br />Even though Order of the Phoenix was my least favorite movie and book, I LOVED the concept of Dumbledore's Army. I just loved seeing all the students in action and actually putting everything they learned into good use. We finally get to meet Luna Lovegood, one of my favorite Harry Potter characters of all time, and I was so ecstatic every time her name was mentioned.<br /><br />As for Umbridge, she was also the ultimate villain in this book. She was the woman you LOVED to HATE and I felt the movie nailed this portrayal so perfectly. If J.K. Rowling's goal was to make you want to rip your own hair to shreds, she succeeded that and more.<br /><br />Overall, I felt the book was unnecessarily long but the movie itself was not much better. Where the book felt too slow, the film adaptation felt too rushed leaving out key details. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix will probably always be my least favorite book and movie in the series, but the worst Harry Potter book is still a whole league better than a lot of other books.",

Rowling\" rel=\"noopener\">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a>) / Italiano<br><br><blockquote>«The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet Drive. Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing; the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought. Deprived of their usual car-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze. The only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flower bed outside number four»</blockquote><p>The \"big number 5\", the longest novel of Harry Potter series, begins... <i>\"HolyMadonna, how big is this book?\"</i> my daughter says, without fear for the number of pages, she looked more excited for the opening of this new adventure. And it starts with a bang, with two dementors attacking Harry and his cousin Dudley in a muggles area, out in the open. The rules of the usual Rowling\\'s game have definitely changed. . The axiom \"before we\\'ll be between the welcoming arms of Hogwarts, and after many things will happen\" no longer exists. The previous chapter of the series, also, started in the spirit of this new trend: you\\'re not safe anywhere. Everything is more complicated for Harry Potter, it is difficult even to sleep by now.</p><blockquote>«There is a room in the Department of Mysteries that is kept locked at all times. It contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death, than human intelligence, than the forces of nature. It is also, perhaps, the most mysterious of the many subjects for study that reside there»</blockquote><p>Let\\'s talk frankly, the entire novel revolves around this room and what\\'s on it, and there are numerous signs and things said that make me think that we will be back on the argument in the future. In fact, despite a series of revelations came about this room at the end of the novel, an air of mystery remains.</p><p>And sadness remains too. So much sadness.</p><p>Vote: 9</p><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1527492554i/25607986._SX540_.jpg\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br><blockquote>«Il giorno più caldo dell\\'estate – almeno fino a quel momento – volgeva al termine e un silenzio sonnacchioso gravava sulle grandi case quadrate di Privet Drive. Le automobili di solito scintillanti sostavano impolverate nei vialetti e i prati un tempo verde smeraldo si stendevano incartapecoriti e giallognoli, perché l\\'irrigazione era stata proibita a causa della siccità. In mancanza delle loro consuete occupazioni – lavare l\\'auto e falciare il prato – gli abitanti di Privet Drive si erano rintanati nella penombra delle loro case fresche, con le finestre spalancate nella speranza di indurre una brezza inesistente a entrare. La sola persona rimasta all\\'aperto era un adolescente che giaceva lungo disteso sulla schiena in un\\'aiuola fuori dal numero quattro»</blockquote><p>Comincia il \"big 5\" di Harry Potter, il volume più lungo della serie. <i>\"O Madonnamia quanto è gigante\"</i>, dice mia figlia quando lo vede, per nulla spaventata dalla mole, anzi eccitata da questa nuova avventura che sta per iniziare. E comincia col botto, con due dissennatori che aggrediscono Harry e il cugino Dudlley in piena terra babbana, alla luce del sole. Sono definitivamente cambiate le regole del gioco della Rowling al quale eravamo abituati in precedenza, ossia prima si arriva tra le accoglienti mura di Hogwarts e poi succedono tante cose. Non più. Già il capitolo precedente della saga era iniziato all\\'insegna del nuovo trend potteriano: non si è più al sicuro da nessuna parte. Per Harry è tutto sempre più complicato, gli riesce difficile perfino dormire in santa pace.</p><blockquote>«Nell\\'Ufficio Misteri c\\'è una stanza che viene tenuta sempre chiusa. Contiene una forza al tempo stesso più meravigliosa e più terribile della morte, dell\\'intelligenza umana e della natura. E forse il più misterioso fra i molti soggetti che vengono studiati laggiù»</blockquote><p>Parliamoci francamente, l\\'intero romanzo ruota attorno a questa stanza e a quello che contiene, e ci sono molteplici indizi e mezze frasi dette che mi fanno pensare che si ritornerà a parlare di essa, tentando di chiarirne l\\'essenza misteriosa, che però permane nonostante tutta una serie di rivelazioni a fine romanzo.</p><p>E permane tristezza. Tanta tristezza.</p><p>Voto: 9</p>",

I know it's not fair to compare, but because the film version of Order of the Phoenix isn't one of my favorites, coupled with the fact that this is the longest novel in the series, I was really nervous to get to this one. Obviously I was a muggle fool who deserves to be chased around by Peeves for a full 24 hours, because this was such a vital installment that really breathed a mature life into the series. The ending of Goblet of Fire is quite dark, but I felt book #5 is where the series really gets down to business and loses the childlike innocence that it clasped tightly for some long. What a brilliant, hauntingly beautiful way to write a series that grows as the reader does. Only two more to go, which makes me quite sad, but also excited to find out how they compare to the rest!",
